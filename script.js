        2: { text: "Where coins jingle and packets rustle loud, The most famous spot that draws a crowd. Not a classroom, yet lessons learnedâ€” How empty pockets quickly turned! Here chilled darkness swirls with cream, And cookies dance in frozen dream. But treasures aren't found on display, Turn your back to where you pay. Behind temptation's busy door, Where weary souls rest and restore, A silver seat waits patiently there, With secrets hidden in its care.", answer: "BRAVO" },
        3: { text: "Where hungry minds gather near, Three faces watch throughout the year. One greets the Statue's morning light, One sees the Taj at noon so bright, One watches Opera House at night. These silent guardians never sleep, Different hours they always keep. But look not up where hands do race, But look not up where hands do race, The secret hides in green's embrace. Beneath world time, where nature grows, Your next clue waits where no one knows.", answer: "WELLDONE" },
        4: { text: "Where power suits and wisdom meet, Along the path beneath your feet, Knowledge watchers keep their doors, While students pass through corridor floors. Between where young minds learn their trade, And where important choices are made, A herald stands in silent pride, Of binary dreams and coding side. Not flesh and bone, but paper, pin, Where computing tales are held within. This messenger of silicon art, Holds the key to your next part. Look where algorithms find their fame, Upon the board that bears the name.", answer: "HATSOFF" },
        5: { text: "Not all stallions have four legs to stand, Some have two wheels, throttle in hand. Among the metal steeds at rest, One holds a code from the past. Take a perfect twenty squared, Subtract the centuries paired. Add the age when Cristo died, Plus one more year beside. Or solve it as the Romans would, One M, nine Cs, if you could. Three Xs and four Is to see, Ancient numbers set you free. Search the steed that bears this mark, Hidden close within its arc. Not where riders place their feet, Your treasure makes this quest complete", answer: "CHEERS" },
        6: { text: "Not all steeds need reins to run, Some have four wheels beneath the sun. Among the metal beasts that shine, One bears a number, yours to find. Take thirty perfect, squared with care, Subtract six score from what's there. Or start with five times perfect four, Then add another eighty more. The Romans carved it in their way, Five hundred with D they'd say. Two hundred more with doubled C, Then L for fifty, can't you see? Three tens with X complete the score, Ancient digits, nothing more. Seek the chariot bearing this sign, Where metal meets the modern line. Not beneath where tires meet ground, Your treasure waits to be found", answer: "FELICITATIONS" },
        7: { text: "Where giants leap but never fly, And orange moons arc through the sky, I stand as sentinel, tall and thin, Guarding the circle where victories begin. My head holds nothing but empty air, Yet thousands aim their hopes up there. I've felt the thunder of running feet, The rubber kiss of triumph and defeat. Warriors dance around my base, In this concrete coliseum space. I watch the sweat, I hear the call, But never move, I just stand tall. Look low, not high, for what you seek, Where my foundation meets concrete. The answer hides where no one scores, Down where my shadow sweeps the floors. Beneath the net where dreams take flight, In the arena of the endless fight, Your secret waits in stillness deepâ€” Check the base where I take my sleep", answer: "GOODJOB" },

        9: { text: "In a tiny world where secrets preen, Perched are watchers, though never seen. Featherless guardians in a cozy crest, Holding the key where they make their rest. Near hands that heal, yet out of plain sight, Among the miniatures that mimic flight. Count not wings, but notice the nest, Where quiet watchers guard your quest. Look closer, seeker, where stillness perches, A clue awaits amid the gentle searches. The small and subtle, the hidden and wise, Hold the next secret beneath their eyes", answer: "RESPECT" },
        10: { text: "Behind the panes where victors rest, And achievements shine their very best, Metal memories stand in rows, Each one a story that glory knows.\n Yet among the champions' metallic pride, A softer creation sits inside. Born not from victory's golden hand, But paper folded, carefully planned.\n Petals that will never wilt or fade, A blossom crafted, delicately made. Not growing from soil, root, or seed, But from skilled fingers' patient deed.\n The secret hides where beauty sits, Just below where the flower fits. In the shrine where honors are displayed, Seek the bloom and find your aid.", answer: "PROPS" }

Yet hidden here, not just serene, A guardian rests, though seldom seen. It does not bloom, nor breathe, nor grow, But waits for dangerâ€™s fiery glow. Coiled and silent, in crimson attire, It guards the place from sudden fire. Not just a garden of beauty and grace, But safetyâ€™s shield within this space. Search where calm and caution meet, Your hidden clue lies at its feet.", answer: "EXCELLENT" },
        2: { text: "A silent sentinel touches the sky, Its shadow falls as people pass by. Many have gathered, many have gazed, Upon this mark where spirits are raised. But your path is not to the height above, Where winds embrace with pride and love. Instead, seek lower, where quiet hides, Where stillness with the earth abides. Not carved in stone, not cast in steel, Yet life surrounds with subtle feel. There, beneath the watcherâ€™s grace, Your hidden clue has found its place.", answer: "WONDERFUL" },
        3: { text: "Where the masses gather to be fed, And coins exchange for daily bread, A chamber echoes with the sound, Of hunger met and answers found. Upon the wall, a sacred text, Declares what offering comes next. Not carved in stone or bound in leather, But changed like seasons, light as feather. The oracle speaks in listed lines, Of sustenance and daily signs. Yet woven in the mundane scroll, Lies something to complete your goal. Not what you eat, but what you read, The very letters plant the seed. The custodian of the feast's design, Has hidden truth within the line. Where steam rises and voices blend, And appetites meet their end, Seek the proclamation on the wall, Your answer's there among it all", answer: "SUPERB" },
        4: { text: "Where the seat of judgment sits enthroned, And decisions carved in stone are honed, A pathway climbs beside this gate, Where souls ascend to higher fate. I am the dragon's ancient foe, Dressed in crimson head to toe. Though I breathe no water, wind, or air, I suffocate what dances there. Chained to walls like a captured beast, I wait for chaos to be released. My belly full of frozen breath, I stand between the living and their death. Seek the place where power sleeps, Where the ascending passage creeps. There I hang in patient wait, A silent guardian by the gate.", answer: "FANTASTIC" },
        5: { text: "I am the keeper of whispers that everyone may hear, A canvas of tomorrow, though yesterday lingers near. My belly swells with fragments of a thousand different tales, Yet silence is my language, written upon my scales. I drink no water, yet I'm drowning in a paper sea, I have no legs to wander, but travelers come to me. The guardian of volumes watches from my back, While I face the rushing river where no water leaves a track. Silver teeth once bit me, holding fast what I must show, My skin bears many scars from all the things I've come to know. I am older every morning, yet refreshed with every dawn, A phoenix made of parchment, with yesterday's news gone. Where the many roads converge into a single beating heart, Where voices blend to thunder before they drift apart, There I stand as witness to the chaos and the calmâ€” Find me where the crossroads rest within the central palm", answer: "BRILLIANT" }

Ask four remedies for four who roam, Bandages to guide you home. For what strange ailment, if he may ask? A headache's cureâ€”that's your task. Glass bottles line the sacred wall, Yet one elixir beats them all. Not for fever, cough, or ache, But for a different path to take. The keeper knows what isn't shown, A remedy that's theirs alone. The answer's written in this verse, Count and name to break the curse.

Seek the vessel that holds no tale, Where ink and words have failed to sail. A spine exists, a cover too, But what should fill it never grew. Born incomplete, forever hollow, No story leads, no plot to follow. The absence makes it what it is, A contradiction in the quiz. Decode what shouldn't be but stands, Request the void with empty hands. The keeper knows the paradox well, Ask for what has naught to tell. Where stories sleep in ordered lines, Seek what defies all the designs, Name the impossible to the one who knows, And forward on your journey goes.", answer: "SCRIPT" },

Behind the counter, secrets hide, The keeper is your faithful guide. But what you need won't be displayed, It's in the shadows, specially made. Approach the master, speak the phrase, Two simple words to end this maze: Ask for something off the chart, \"The special drink\" to reach the next part.
